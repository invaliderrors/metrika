# Metrika — Observability

> One correlation identity across three runtimes. If a customer gives you a request ID, you can see everything that happened.

## 1. Stack

| Concern               | Tool                              | Why                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Traces, metrics, logs | **OpenTelemetry → Grafana Cloud** | One OTLP endpoint for all three signals; generous free tier; Grafana-native as required; no vendor SDK in the code |
| Error tracking        | **Sentry** (API, web, workers)    | Grouping, release health and source maps are genuinely better than a logs-based approach                           |
| Uptime                | Grafana Synthetic Monitoring      | External probe of `/health` and the golden path                                                                    |
| Product analytics     | **PostHog**, fed by domain events | Never called from domain code                                                                                      |

OpenTelemetry rather than a vendor SDK means the backend is a configuration change, not a refactor. That optionality matters when the free tier stops being enough.

## 2. Correlation — the thing that actually matters

```
Browser generates X-Request-Id
   → API: Fastify hook adopts or generates it; starts the root span; binds to AsyncLocalStorage
   → every log line in the request carries requestId + traceId + spanId + userId + organizationId
   → workflow start: requestId and traceId become Temporal search attributes and a memo
   → activity dispatch: propagated as OTel baggage
   → Python worker: structlog binds them to every log line; spans link to the parent trace
   → API error response: { error: { requestId } }
```

A support ticket saying "my quote failed, request ID `req_01H...`" resolves to a complete distributed trace spanning the browser, the API, Temporal and two Python workers. This is the single highest-value observability investment, and it must be built in Phase 0 — retrofitting correlation IDs means touching every log call in the codebase.

Temporal search attributes are what make workflows findable: `MetrikaOrganizationId`, `MetrikaModelVersionId`, `MetrikaQuoteId`, `MetrikaRequestId`. An operator investigating "what happened to this quote" queries Temporal directly by quote ID rather than grepping.

## 3. Logging

Structured JSON everywhere. Pino (Node), structlog (Python). Never `console.log` — a lint rule enforces it.

```jsonc
{
  "level": "info", "time": "2026-08-07T14:22:31.442Z",
  "requestId": "req_01H...", "traceId": "4bf92f...", "spanId": "00f067...",
  "userId": "usr_...", "organizationId": "org_...",
  "modelVersionId": "mv_...", "workflowId": "model-processing:mv_...",
  "msg": "geometry analysis completed",
  "durationMs": 8420, "triangleCount": 1240000, "analyzerVersion": "geometry-worker@1.4.2"
}
```

### Redaction — an allowlist mindset

**The list is defined once, in `packages/contracts/src/redaction.ts`, as
`RedactedFieldName`.** It is a set of *field names*, not of Pino paths: `pnpm
contracts:emit` carries it into `metrika_core.contracts` as a `StrEnum`, so the
Python side reads the same list as generated code and CI fails on a diff. Each
sink derives its own matcher from those names, because each runtime matches
differently — Pino needs a path per name (`password` and `*.password` are two
rules), structlog matches the event dict's keys and their word suffixes, and
Sentry's `beforeSend` walks the event. They agree on the names; they cannot
agree on the matching, and the module says so.

The block below is the Pino shape those names are derived into.

```ts
redact: {
  paths: [
    'req.headers.authorization', 'req.headers.cookie', '*.password', '*.token',
    '*.signedUrl', '*.presignedUrl', '*.uploadUrl', '*.downloadUrl',
    '*.providerPayload', '*.paymentPayload', '*.webhookSecret',
    '*.filename', '*.originalFilename', '*.projectName',
  ],
  censor: '[REDACTED]',
}
```

Two categories deserve comment:

- **Signed URLs are credentials.** A signed URL in a log is a leaked model. They are redacted in Pino, in structlog, and in Sentry's `beforeSend`.
- **File names and project names are customer intellectual property.** "Torre_Bacatá_Fase3_Final.stl" in a log tells an observer what an architect is working on. They are redacted; the model ID is the identifier used in logs.

Levels: `error` for unexpected failures (Sentry event); `warn` for expected domain failures worth watching (slicing failed, payment declined); `info` for lifecycle events; `debug` off in production.

## 4. Metrics

### Golden signals

`http_server_duration` (histogram, by route and status), `http_server_errors`, `db_query_duration`, `db_pool_utilization`, `temporal_workflow_duration`, `temporal_activity_failures`, `temporal_task_queue_depth`.

### Domain metrics — the ones that describe the business

| Metric                                      | Type      | Alert                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `metrika_upload_total{result}`              | counter   | Success rate < 97% over 1 h                    |
| `metrika_analysis_duration_seconds`         | histogram | p95 > 120 s                                    |
| `metrika_analysis_total{result}`            | counter   | Success rate < 95%                             |
| `metrika_slice_duration_seconds`            | histogram | p95 > 300 s                                    |
| `metrika_slice_total{result,cached}`        | counter   | Success rate < 95%                             |
| `metrika_slice_cache_hit_ratio`             | gauge     | Sudden drop — a key input changed unexpectedly |
| `metrika_quote_duration_seconds`            | histogram | p95 > 180 s (upload → quote ready)             |
| `metrika_quote_total{result}`               | counter   | —                                              |
| `metrika_model_triangles`                   | histogram | Distribution shift → capacity planning         |
| `metrika_units_ambiguous_ratio`             | gauge     | Rising → the inference heuristic is degrading  |
| `metrika_payment_total{provider,result}`    | counter   | Failure rate > 10%                             |
| `metrika_workflow_failures_total{workflow}` | counter   | Any sustained increase                         |
| `metrika_estimate_deviation_ratio{profile}` | histogram | **median deviation > 15% — margin is eroding** |

That last metric is the one that protects the business. It exists from Phase 11 and is the closing of the loop described in [PRICING_ENGINE.md](./PRICING_ENGINE.md#10-calibration--closing-the-loop-with-reality).

Metrics are emitted from **one module** (`infrastructure/telemetry/metrics.ts`) exposing named, typed recorders — not scattered `counter.add()` calls. A metric with an inconsistent label set is a metric you cannot query.

## 5. Business KPIs

Product analytics through PostHog, fed by **domain event subscribers**, never from domain code:

```
model_uploaded · analysis_completed · units_confirmed · configuration_changed
· quote_generated · quote_accepted · checkout_started · payment_completed · order_delivered
```

Derived: upload success rate, analysis success rate, median analysis duration, slice success rate, median quote duration, **quote conversion rate** (accepted ÷ generated), average order value, gross manufacturing margin (from actuals), reprint rate, failure rate, and printer utilisation from Phase 14.

Events carry identifiers and coarse categories only. Never file names, dimensions, geometry or project names — see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md#10-privacy-and-confidentiality). An analytics vendor must never be able to reconstruct what a customer is designing.

---

## 6. Dashboards and alerts

Four dashboards: **Platform Health** (golden signals, error budget), **Pipeline** (the funnel from upload to quote-ready with drop-off at each stage), **Business** (conversion, order value, margin), **Cost** (Fargate hours, S3 growth, Temporal actions, slice-cache savings).

Alert routing is deliberately narrow, because a solo operator with a noisy pager stops reading it:

| Severity     | Examples                                                                                                  | Route             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Page**     | API down, database unreachable, payment webhooks failing, workflow failure rate spike                     | Push notification |
| **Ticket**   | Analysis success rate degraded, slicer regression failed, estimate deviation over threshold, cost anomaly | Daily digest      |
| **Log only** | Individual expected failures                                                                              | Dashboards        |

Every alert names a runbook in `docs/runbooks/`. An alert without a documented response is noise with a siren.

## 7. Health checks

```
GET /health/live     → process is up. No dependency checks. Used by ECS
GET /health/ready    → DB, Redis, S3, Temporal reachable. Used by the load balancer
GET /health/deep     → authenticated; per-dependency latency. Used by monitoring
```

`live` must never check dependencies. A liveness probe that fails because Redis is slow causes ECS to kill healthy tasks and turns a degradation into an outage — a classic self-inflicted incident.

## 8. Performance budgets

| Surface                  | Budget              | Instrumented by                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| API reads p95            | < 300 ms            | OTel histogram per route             |
| API writes p95           | < 500 ms            | Same                                 |
| DB query p95             | < 50 ms             | Prisma OTel instrumentation          |
| Queries per request      | Per-endpoint budget | Prisma middleware, asserted in tests |
| Analysis p95             | < 120 s             | Activity span                        |
| Slice p95                | < 300 s             | Activity span                        |
| Upload → quote-ready p95 | < 180 s             | Workflow span                        |
| Web LCP p75              | < 2.0 s             | Vercel Speed Insights                |
| Viewer chunk             | < 400 KB gzip       | CI bundle check                      |
| Route JS (non-viewer)    | < 180 KB gzip       | CI bundle check                      |

**Instrument first, optimise second.** No performance work begins without a span or a metric showing the cost. This is stated because the temptation to optimise the 3D viewer by intuition will be strong and usually wrong.
